This was done as a part of Springboard Data Science Career Track course (Unit17.2.2. Take-Home Challenge: Ultimate Technologies Inc.).

# Data Analysis Interview Challenge:

## Part 1 ‑ Exploratory data analysis
The given file contained (simulated) timestamps of user logins in a particular geographic location. These login counts were aggregate based on 15 minute time intervals, and
visualized and described. 

## Part 2 ‑ Experiment and metrics design
The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms. However, a toll bridge between the two cities caused driver-partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver-partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs. These questions were solved in the file.
1. What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiment in encouraging driver-partners to serve both cities, and why would you choose this metric?
2. Describe a practical experiment you would design to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. 
a. how you will implement the experiment
b. what statistical test(s) you will conduct to verify the significance of the observation
c. how you would interpret the results and provide recommendations to the city operations team along with any caveats.

## Part 3 ‑ Predictive modeling
Ultimate is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an Ultimate account in January 2014 were provided. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations were implemented. Predictive models were built and evaluated and compared each other. The best predictors for retention were discussed, and suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Ultimate were offered.


The following list includes the topics:
- datetime
- data cleaning
- EDA (visualization)
- classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVC, logistic regression, k-NN, random forest, GBDT)
- model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score)
